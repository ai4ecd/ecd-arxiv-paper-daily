Current state-of-the-art research in blood vessel segmentation from retinal images is based on convolutional neural networks. The solutions proposed so far are trained and tested on images from a few available retinal blood vessel segmentation datasets, which might limit their performance when given an image with retinopathy of prematurity signs. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three high-performing convolutional neural networks for retinal blood vessel segmentation in the context of blood vessel segmentation on retinopathy of prematurity retinal images. The main motive behind the study is to test if existing public datasets suffice to develop a high-performing predictor that could assist an ophthalmologist in retinopathy of prematurity diagnosis. To do so, we create a dataset consisting solely of retinopathy of prematurity images with retinal blood vessel annotations manually labeled by two observers, where one is the ophthalmologist experienced in retinopathy of prematurity treatment. Experimental results show that all three solutions have difficulties in detecting the retinal blood vessels of infants due to a lower contrast compared to images from public datasets as demonstrated by a significant drop in classification sensitivity. All three solutions segment alongside retinal also choroidal blood vessels which are not used to diagnose retinopathy of prematurity, but instead represent noise and are confused with retinal blood vessels. By visual and numerical observations, we observe that existing solutions for retinal blood vessel segmentation need improvement toward more detailed datasets or deeper models in order to assist the ophthalmologist in retinopathy of prematurity diagnosis.|

These include widely used parametric choices like the multivariate normal, skew-t, Laplace, and several others. We also introduce the multiple-choice LASSO, a novel penalized method for choosing among alternative constraints on the same parameter. A hierarchical multiple-choice LASSO penalized likelihood is optimized to perform simultaneous model selection and inference within the GH family. We illustrate our approach through a simulation study and a real data example about pre-term infants. The methodology proposed in this paper has been implemented in R functions which are available as supplementary material.|

However, young stars tend to be extremely variable in both photometry and radial velocity, which makes constraining these properties challenging. The V1298 Tau system of four ~0.5 Rjup planets transiting a pre-main sequence star presents an important, if stress-inducing, opportunity to directly observe and measure the properties of infant planets. Su\'arez-Mascare\~no et al. (2021) published radial-velocity-derived masses for two of the V1298 Tau planets using a state-of-the-art Gaussian Process regression framework. The planetary densities computed from these masses were surprisingly high, implying extremely rapid contraction after formation in tension with most existing planet formation theories. In an effort to further constrain the masses of the V1298 Tau planets, we obtained 36 RVs using Keck/HIRES, and analyzed them in concert with published RVs and photometry. Through performing a suite of cross validation tests, we found evidence that the preferred model of SM21 suffers from overfitting, defined as the inability to predict unseen data, rendering the masses unreliable. We detail several potential causes of this overfitting, many of which may be important for other RV analyses of other active stars, and recommend that additional time and resources be allocated to understanding and mitigating activity in active young stars such as V1298 Tau.|
|**2023-06-09**|**Two Independent Teachers are Better Role Model**|Afifa Khaled et.al.|[2306.05745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05745v1)|[link](https://github.com/AfifaKhaled/Two-Independent-Teachers-are-Better-Role-Model)|Recent deep learning models have attracted substantial attention in infant brain analysis. These models have performed state-of-the-art performance, such as semi-supervised techniques (e.g., Temporal Ensembling, mean teacher). However, these models depend on an encoder-decoder structure with stacked local operators to gather long-range information, and the local operators limit the efficiency and effectiveness. Besides, the $MRI$ data contain different tissue properties ($TPs$) such as $T1$ and $T2$. One major limitation of these models is that they use both data as inputs to the segment process, i.e., the models are trained on the dataset once, and it requires much computational and memory requirements during inference. In this work, we address the above limitations by designing a new deep-learning model, called 3D-DenseUNet, which works as adaptable global aggregation blocks in down-sampling to solve the issue of spatial information loss. The self-attention module connects the down-sampling blocks to up-sampling blocks, and integrates the feature maps in three dimensions of spatial and channel, effectively improving the representation potential and discriminating ability of the model. Additionally, we propose a new method called Two Independent Teachers ($2IT$), that summarizes the model weights instead of label predictions. Each teacher model is trained on different types of brain data, $T1$ and $T2$, respectively. Then, a fuse model is added to improve test accuracy and enable training with fewer parameters and labels compared to the Temporal Ensembling method without modifying the network architecture. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.|

They arise for the semilinear scalar parabolic PDE   \begin{equation}\label{eq:*}   u_t = u_{xx} + f(x,u,u_x) \tag{$*$}   \end{equation} on the unit interval $0 < x<1$, under Neumann boundary conditions. This models the interplay of reaction, advection, and diffusion.   Our classification is based on the Sturm meanders, which arise from a shooting approach to the ODE boundary value problem of equilibrium solutions $u=v(x)$. Specifically, we address meanders with only three ``noses'', each of which is innermost to a nested family of upper or lower meander arcs. The Chafee-Infante paradigm of 1974, with cubic nonlinearity $f=f(u)$, features just two noses.   We present, and fully prove, a precise description of global PDE connection graphs, graded by Morse index, for such gradient-like Morse-Smale systems \eqref{eq:*}. The directed edges denote PDE heteroclinic orbits $v_1 \leadsto v_2$ between equilibrium vertices $v_1, v_2$ of adjacent Morse index. The connection graphs can be described as a lattice-like structure of Chafee-Infante subgraphs. However, this simple description requires us to adjoin a single ``equilibrium'' vertex, formally, at Morse level -1. Surprisingly, for parabolic PDEs based on irreversible diffusion, the connection graphs then also exhibit global time reversibility.|

In order to fully realize the potential of these approaches and further our understanding of how infants learn language, simulations must closely emulate real-life situations by training on developmentally plausible corpora and benchmarking against appropriate test sets. To this end, we propose a language-acquisition-friendly benchmark to probe spoken language models at the lexical and syntactic levels, both of which are compatible with the vocabulary typical of children's language experiences. This paper introduces the benchmark and summarizes a range of experiments showing its usefulness. In addition, we highlight two exciting challenges that need to be addressed for further progress: bridging the gap between text and speech and between clean speech and in-the-wild speech.|
|**2023-06-01**|**Generalizability analyses with a partially nested trial design: the Necrotizing Enterocolitis Surgery Trial**|Sarah E. Robertson et.al.|[2306.00855v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00855v1)|null|We discuss generalizability analyses under a partially nested trial design, where part of the trial is nested within a cohort of trial-eligible individuals, while the rest of the trial is not nested. This design arises, for example, when only some centers participating in a trial are able to collect data on non-randomized individuals, or when data on non-randomized individuals cannot be collected for the full duration of the trial. Our work is motivated by the Necrotizing Enterocolitis Surgery Trial (NEST) that compared initial laparotomy versus peritoneal drain for infants with necrotizing enterocolitis or spontaneous intestinal perforation. During the first phase of the study, data were collected from randomized individuals as well as consenting non-randomized individuals; during the second phase of the study, however, data were only collected from randomized individuals, resulting in a partially nested trial design. We propose methods for generalizability analyses with partially nested trial designs. We describe identification conditions and propose estimators for causal estimands in the target population of all trial-eligible individuals, both randomized and non-randomized, in the part of the data where the trial is nested, while using trial information spanning both parts. We evaluate the estimators in a simulation study.|
|**2023-05-25**|**Emergence of a phonological bias in ChatGPT**|Juan Manuel Toro et.al.|[2305.15929v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15929v2)|null|Current large language models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, have captured the public's attention because how remarkable they are in the use of language. Here, I demonstrate that ChatGPT displays phonological biases that are a hallmark of human language processing. More concretely, just like humans, ChatGPT has a consonant bias. That is, the chatbot has a tendency to use consonants over vowels to identify words. This is observed across languages that differ in their relative distribution of consonants and vowels such as English and Spanish. Despite the differences in how current artificial intelligence language models are trained to process linguistic stimuli and how human infants acquire language, such training seems to be enough for the emergence of a phonological bias in ChatGPT|
|**2023-05-24**|**From Interactive to Co-Constructive Task Learning**|Anna-Lisa Vollmer et.al.|[2305.15535v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15535v1)|null|Humans have developed the capability to teach relevant aspects of new or adapted tasks to a social peer with very few task demonstrations by making use of scaffolding strategies that leverage prior knowledge and importantly prior joint experience to yield a joint understanding and a joint execution of the required steps to solve the task. This process has been discovered and analyzed in parent-infant interaction and constitutes a ``co-construction'' as it allows both, the teacher and the learner, to jointly contribute to the task. We propose to focus research in robot interactive learning on this co-construction process to enable robots to learn from non-expert users in everyday situations. In the following, we will review current proposals for interactive task learning and discuss their main contributions with respect to the entailing interaction. We then discuss our notion of co-construction and summarize research insights from adult-child and human-robot interactions to elucidate its nature in more detail. From this overview we finally derive research desiderata that entail the dimensions architecture, representation, interaction and explainability.|
|**2023-05-22**|**Developmental Curiosity and Social Interaction in Virtual Agents**|Chris Doyle et.al.|[2305.13396v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13396v1)|null|Infants explore their complex physical and social environment in an organized way. To gain insight into what intrinsic motivations may help structure this exploration, we create a virtual infant agent and place it in a developmentally-inspired 3D environment with no external rewards. The environment has a virtual caregiver agent with the capability to interact contingently with the infant agent in ways that resemble play. We test intrinsic reward functions that are similar to motivations that have been proposed to drive exploration in humans: surprise, uncertainty, novelty, and learning progress. These generic reward functions lead the infant agent to explore its environment and discover the contingencies that are embedded into the caregiver agent. The reward functions that are proxies for novelty and uncertainty are the most successful in generating diverse experiences and activating the environment contingencies. We also find that learning a world model in the presence of an attentive caregiver helps the infant agent learn how to predict scenarios with challenging social and physical dynamics. Taken together, our findings provide insight into how curiosity-like intrinsic rewards and contingent social interaction lead to dynamic social behavior and the creation of a robust predictive world model.|
|**2023-05-21**|**Towards Robust Family-Infant Audio Analysis Based on Unsupervised Pretraining of Wav2vec 2.0 on Large-Scale Unlabeled Family Audio**|Jialu Li et.al.|[2305.12530v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12530v2)|null|To perform automatic family audio analysis, past studies have collected recordings using phone, video, or audio-only recording devices like LENA, investigated supervised learning methods, and used or fine-tuned general-purpose embeddings learned from large pretrained models. In this study, we advance the audio component of a new infant wearable multi-modal device called LittleBeats (LB) by learning family audio representation via wav2vec 2.0 (W2V2) pertaining. We show given a limited number of labeled LB home recordings, W2V2 pretrained using 1k-hour of unlabeled home recordings outperforms oracle W2V2 pretrained on 52k-hour unlabeled audio in terms of parent/infant speaker diarization (SD) and vocalization classifications (VC) at home. Extra relevant external unlabeled and labeled data further benefit W2V2 pretraining and fine-tuning. With SpecAug and environmental speech corruptions, we obtain 12% relative gain on SD and moderate boost on VC. Code and model weights are available.|
|**2023-05-18**|**Comparing Machines and Children: Using Developmental Psychology Experiments to Assess the Strengths and Weaknesses of LaMDA Responses**|Eliza Kosoy et.al.|[2305.11243v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11243v1)|null|Developmental psychologists have spent decades devising experiments to test the intelligence and knowledge of infants and children, tracing the origin of crucial concepts and capacities. Moreover, experimental techniques in developmental psychology have been carefully designed to discriminate the cognitive capacities that underlie particular behaviors. We propose that using classical experiments from child development is a particularly effective way to probe the computational abilities of AI models, in general, and LLMs in particular. First, the methodological techniques of developmental psychology, such as the use of novel stimuli to control for past experience or control conditions to determine whether children are using simple associations, can be equally helpful for assessing the capacities of LLMs. In parallel, testing LLMs in this way can tell us whether the information that is encoded in text is sufficient to enable particular responses, or whether those responses depend on other kinds of information, such as information from exploration of the physical world. In this work we adapt classical developmental experiments to evaluate the capabilities of LaMDA, a large language model from Google. We propose a novel LLM Response Score (LRS) metric which can be used to evaluate other language models, such as GPT. We find that LaMDA generates appropriate responses that are similar to those of children in experiments involving social understanding, perhaps providing evidence that knowledge of these domains is discovered through language. On the other hand, LaMDA's responses in early object and action understanding, theory of mind, and especially causal reasoning tasks are very different from those of young children, perhaps showing that these domains require more real-world, self-initiated exploration and cannot simply be learned from patterns in language input.|

The theory of PI is rich in the context of centralized learning, but its study is still in the infant stage under the federated setting. This paper explores the federated version of Approximate PI (API) and derives its error bound, taking into account the approximation error introduced by environment heterogeneity. We theoretically prove that a proper client selection scheme can reduce this error bound. Based on the theoretical result, we propose a client selection algorithm to alleviate the additional approximation error caused by environment heterogeneity. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other biased and unbiased client selection methods on the federated mountain car problem by effectively selecting clients with a lower level of heterogeneity from the population distribution.|

Wade ruling in the United States. Previous literature showed that the illegality of abortion could have serious consequences, as women might seek unsafe pregnancy terminations leading to increased maternal mortality rates and negative effects on their reproductive health. Therefore, the stances of the abortion-related Facebook posts were analyzed at the state level in the United States from May 4 until June 30, 2022, right after the Supreme Court's decision was disclosed. In more detail, the pre-trained Transformer architecture-based model was fine-tuned on a manually labeled training set to obtain a stance detection model suitable for the collected dataset. Afterward, we employed appropriate statistical tests to examine the relationships between public opinion regarding abortion, abortion legality, political leaning, and factors measuring the overall population's health, health knowledge, and vulnerability per state. We found that states with a higher number of views against abortion also have higher infant and maternal mortality rates. Furthermore, the stance of social media posts per state is mostly matching with the current abortion laws in these states. While aligned with existing literature, these findings indicate how public opinion, laws, and women's and infants' health are related, and interventions are required to educate and protect women, especially in vulnerable populations.|
|**2023-05-16**|**Evaluation of self-supervised pre-training for automatic infant movement classification using wearable movement sensors**|Einari Vaaras et.al.|[2305.09366v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09366v1)|[link](https://github.com/SPEECHCOG/data2vec_maiju)|The recently-developed infant wearable MAIJU provides a means to automatically evaluate infants' motor performance in an objective and scalable manner in out-of-hospital settings. This information could be used for developmental research and to support clinical decision-making, such as detection of developmental problems and guiding of their therapeutic interventions. MAIJU-based analyses rely fully on the classification of infant's posture and movement; it is hence essential to study ways to increase the accuracy of such classifications, aiming to increase the reliability and robustness of the automated analysis. Here, we investigated how self-supervised pre-training improves performance of the classifiers used for analyzing MAIJU recordings, and we studied whether performance of the classifier models is affected by context-selective quality-screening of pre-training data to exclude periods of little infant movement or with missing sensors. Our experiments show that i) pre-training the classifier with unlabeled data leads to a robust accuracy increase of subsequent classification models, and ii) selecting context-relevant pre-training data leads to substantial further improvements in the classifier performance.|

Using ward-level panel data from prewar Tokyo City, we found that public pawn loans were associated with reductions in infant and fetal death rates, potentially through improved nutrition and hygiene measures. Simple calculations suggest that popularizing public pawnshops led to a 6% and 8% decrease in infant mortality and fetal death rates, respectively, from 1927 to 1935. Contrarily, private pawnshops showed no significant association with health improvements. Our findings enrich the expanding literature on demographics and financial histories.|

Biometric authentication technology has been investigated to address child recognition in the absence of reliable ID documents. We present a mobile-based contactless palmprint recognition system, called Child Palm-ID, which meets the requirements of usability, hygiene, cost, and accuracy for child recognition. Using a contactless child palmprint database, Child-PalmDB1, consisting of 19,158 images from 1,020 unique palms (in the age range of 6 mos. to 48 mos.), we report a TAR=94.11% @ FAR=0.1%. The proposed Child Palm-ID system is also able to recognize adults, achieving a TAR=99.4% on the CASIA contactless palmprint database and a TAR=100% on the COEP contactless adult palmprint database, both @ FAR=0.1%. These accuracies are competitive with the SOTA provided by COTS systems. Despite these high accuracies, we show that the TAR for time-separated child-palmprints is only 78.1% @ FAR=0.1%.|
|**2023-05-03**|**Analysing the Impact of Audio Quality on the Use of Naturalistic Long-Form Recordings for Infant-Directed Speech Research**|MarÃ­a Andrea Cruz BlandÃ³n et.al.|[2305.01965v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01965v1)|[link](https://github.com/SPEECHCOG/ids_audio_quality_analysis)|Modelling of early language acquisition aims to understand how infants bootstrap their language skills. The modelling encompasses properties of the input data used for training the models, the cognitive hypotheses and their algorithmic implementations being tested, and the evaluation methodologies to compare models to human data. Recent developments have enabled the use of more naturalistic training data for computational models. This also motivates development of more naturalistic tests of model behaviour. A crucial step towards such an aim is to develop representative speech datasets consisting of speech heard by infants in their natural environments. However, a major drawback of such recordings is that they are typically noisy, and it is currently unclear how the sound quality could affect analyses and modelling experiments conducted on such data. In this paper, we explore this aspect for the case of infant-directed speech (IDS) and adult-directed speech (ADS) analysis. First, we manually and automatically annotated audio quality of utterances extracted from two corpora of child-centred long-form recordings (in English and French). We then compared acoustic features of IDS and ADS in an in-lab dataset and across different audio quality subsets of naturalistic data. Finally, we assessed how the audio quality and recording environment may change the conclusions of a modelling analysis using a recent self-supervised learning model. Our results show that the use of modest and high audio quality naturalistic speech data result in largely similar conclusions on IDS and ADS in terms of acoustic analyses and modelling experiments. We also found that an automatic sound quality assessment tool can be used to screen out useful parts of long-form recordings for a closer analysis with comparable results to that of manual quality annotation.|

Due to the nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) imposed in the COVID-19 outbreak, the seasonal transmission pattern of RSV has been discontinued in 2020 and then shifted months ahead in 2021 in the northern hemisphere. It is critical to understand how COVID-19 impacts RSV and build predictive algorithms to forecast the timing and intensity of RSV reemergence in post-COVID-19 seasons. In this paper, we propose a deep coupled tensor factorization machine, dubbed as DeCom, for post COVID-19 RSV prediction. DeCom leverages tensor factorization and residual modeling. It enables us to learn the disrupted RSV transmission reliably under COVID-19 by taking both the regular seasonal RSV transmission pattern and the NPI into consideration. Experimental results on a real RSV dataset show that DeCom is more accurate than the state-of-the-art RSV prediction algorithms and achieves up to 46% lower root mean square error and 49% lower mean absolute error for country-level prediction compared to the baselines.|
|**2023-05-02**|**Self-supervised learning for infant cry analysis**|Arsenii Gorin et.al.|[2305.01578v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01578v1)|null|In this paper, we explore self-supervised learning (SSL) for analyzing a first-of-its-kind database of cry recordings containing clinical indications of more than a thousand newborns. Specifically, we target cry-based detection of neurological injury as well as identification of cry triggers such as pain, hunger, and discomfort. Annotating a large database in the medical setting is expensive and time-consuming, typically requiring the collaboration of several experts over years. Leveraging large amounts of unlabeled audio data to learn useful representations can lower the cost of building robust models and, ultimately, clinical solutions. In this work, we experiment with self-supervised pre-training of a convolutional neural network on large audio datasets. We show that pre-training with SSL contrastive loss (SimCLR) performs significantly better than supervised pre-training for both neuro injury and cry triggers. In addition, we demonstrate further performance gains through SSL-based domain adaptation using unlabeled infant cries. We also show that using such SSL-based pre-training for adaptation to cry sounds decreases the need for labeled data of the overall system.|

It has been argued that a basis of human-level intelligence is mankind's ability to perform relational reasoning: the comparison of different objects, measuring similarity, grasping of relations between objects and the converse, figuring out the odd one out in a set of objects. Mankind can even do this with objects they have never seen before. Here we show how ClusterFlow, a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering framework can operate on trained NNs utilising the rich multi-dimensional class and feature data found at the pre-SoftMax layer to build a hyperspacial map of classes/features and this adds more human-like functionality to modern deep convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate this with 3 tasks. 1. the statistical learning based `mistakes' made by infants when attending to images of cats and dogs. 2. improving both the resilience to hacking images and the accurate measure of certainty in deep-NNs. 3. Relational reasoning over sets of images, including those not known to the NN nor seen before. We also demonstrate that ClusterFlow can work on non-NN data and deal with missing data by testing it on a Chemistry dataset. This work suggests that modern deep NNs can be made more human-like without re-training of the NNs. As it is known that some methods used in deep and convolutional NNs are not biologically plausible or perhaps even the best approach: the ClusterFlow framework can sit on top of any NN and will be a useful tool to add as NNs are improved in this regard.|

In this work, we use the stacking technique through 46 lines of sight with Chandra ACIS-S HETG totaling over 10Ms of exposure time and 9 lines of sight with ACIS-S LETG observations totaling over 1Ms of exposure time, to study in absorption the presence of highly ionized metals arising from the super-virial temperature phase of the CGM. Focusing in the spectral range $4 - 8$ $\r{A}$, we were able to confirm the presence of this hot phase with high significance. We detected transitions of Si XIV K$\alpha$ (with total significance of 6.0$\sigma$) and, for the first time, SXVI K (total significance 4.8$\sigma$) in the rest frame of our own Galaxy. For S XVI K$\alpha$ we found a column density of $1.50^{+0.44}_{-0.38} \times 10^{16} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. For Si XIV K$\alpha$ we measured a column density of $0.87\pm{0.16} \times 10^{16} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. The lines of sight used in this work are spread across the sky, probing widely separated regions of the CGM. Therefore, our results indicate that this newly discovered hot medium extends throughout the halo, and is not related only to the Galactic Bubbles. The hot gas location, distribution, and covering factor, however, remain unknown. This component might contribute significantly to the missing baryons and metals in the Milky Way.|

As evidenced from natural documentation, the immature predators possess the potential to predate albeit not as competently as the adults. Nevertheless, this potentiality is not acquired immediately after their incipience of life, hence, the immature stage is branched off into the infant stage, the stage with extensive reliance on the adults, and the juvenile stage, the stage with the potential to predate but not to procreate. In this paper, this inaugural concept is coupled with injuries in the juvenile stage as the repercussion of their incompetency in predating, thereby ensuing a delay in their maturation. With the incentive to investigate the ascendancy of these refinements over the whole system, stability analyses along with various bifurcation analyses around the equilibrium points of the system are corroborated. In addition to Hopf, transcritical, and saddle node bifurcations, the existence of Bogdanov-Takens point, cusp point, Bautin bifurcation point, bloom phenomenon, twice occurring Hopf bifurcation, and bi-stability phenomenon make the paper appreciably more rich and efficacious.|

Recent progress hinges upon sparse regression of observables using extensive libraries of candidate functions. However, it remains challenging to model hidden non-observable control variables governing switching between different dynamical regimes. Here we develop a data-efficient derivative-free method, IHCV, for the Identification of Hidden Control Variables. First, the performance and robustness of IHCV against noise are evaluated by benchmarking the IHCV method using well-known bifurcation models (saddle-node, transcritical, pitchfork, Hopf). Next, we demonstrate that IHCV discovers hidden driver variables in the Lorenz, van der Pol, Hodgkin-Huxley, and Fitzhugh-Nagumo models. Finally, IHCV generalizes to the case when only partial observational is given, as demonstrated using the toggle switch model, the genetic repressilator oscillator, and a Waddington landscape model. Our proof-of-principle illustrates that utilizing normal forms could facilitate the data-efficient and scalable discovery of hidden variables controlling transitions between different dynamical regimes and non-linear models.|

We present detailed analysis of this SN using our high-cadence KMTNet multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and publicly available data. We provide the first measurements of its epochs of explosion (MJD 59529.32 $\pm$ 0.16) as well as ``first light'' (MJD 59529.85 $\pm$ 0.55) associated with the main ejecta ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ distribution. This places our first detection of SN 2021aefx at $\sim -$0.5 hours since ``first light'', indicating the presence of additional power sources. Our peak-spectrum confirms its Type Ia sub-classification as intermediate between Core-Normal and Broad-Line, and we estimate the ejecta mass to be $\sim$ 1.34 $M_{\odot}$. The pre-peak spectral evolution identifies fast-expanding material reaching $>$ 40,000 km s$^{-1}$ (the fastest ever observed in Type Ia SNe) and at least two distinct homologously-expanding ejecta components: (1) a normal-velocity (12,400 km s$^{-1}$) component consistent with the typical photospheric evolution of Chandrasekhar-mass ejecta; and (2) a high-velocity (23,500 km s$^{-1}$) component visible during the first $\sim$ 3.6 days post-explosion, which locates the component within the outer $<$ 16\% of the ejecta mass. Asymmetric, subsonic explosion processes producing a non-spherical photosphere provide an explanation for the simultaneous presence of the two components, as well as the red excess emission via a slight ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ enrichment in the outer $\sim$ 0.5\% of the ejecta mass. Our spectrum from 300 days post-peak advances the constraint against non-degenerate companions and further supports a near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion origin. Off-center ignited delayed-detonations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs may be responsible for the observed features of SN 2021aefx in some normal Type Ia SNe.|

To this end, we employ time series analysis methods based on data from 1968 to 2021 and panel data techniques based on department-level statistical information from 1984 to 2019. The results of our first econometric exercise indicate a cointegration relationship between fertility and economic performance, education and infant mortality, with differences observed by reproductive stage. We find a negative relationship between income and fertility for women aged 20-29 that persists for women aged 30 and over. This result suggests that having children is perceived as an opportunity cost for women in this age group. We also observe a negative relationship between education and adolescent fertility, which has implications for the design of public policies. A panel data analysis with econometric techniques allowing us to control for unobserved heterogeneity confirms that income is a relevant factor for all groups of women and reinforces the crucial role of education in reducing teenage fertility. We also identify a negative correlation between fertility and employment rates for women aged 30 and above. We outline some possible explanations for these findings in the context of work-life balance issues and argue for the importance of implementing social policies to address them.|

This article discusses the effect of TMC on a mimetic pulmonary surfactant, Curosurf, a low-viscosity lipid formulation administered to preterm infants with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Curosurf exhibits a strong interaction with TMC, resulting in the formation of aggregates at electrostatic charge stoichiometry. At nanoscale, Curosurf undergoes a profound reorganization of its lipid vesicles in terms of size and lamellarity. The initial micron-sized vesicles (average size 4.8 microns) give way to a froth-like network of unilamellar vesicles about 300 nm in size. Under such conditions, neutralization of the cationic charges by pulmonary surfactant may inhibit TMC permeation enhancer capacity, especially as electrostatic charge complexation is found at low TMC content. The permeation properties of pulmonary surfactant-neutralized TMC should then be evaluated for its applicability as a permeation enhancer for inhalation in the alveolar region.|

However, many of these patterns are unstable and therefore challenging to observe. To overcome this limitation, we present new noninvasive feedback controls based on symmetry groupoids. As a concrete example, we employ these controls to selectively stabilize unstable equilibria of the Chafee--Infante equation under Dirichlet boundary conditions on the interval. Unlike conventional reflection-based control schemes, our approach incorporates additional symmetries that enable us to design new convolution controls for stabilization. By demonstrating the efficacy of our method, we provide a new tool for investigating and controlling systems with unstable patterns, with potential implications for a wide range of scientific disciplines.|

One barrier to clinical (or algorithmic) assessment of NNS stems from its sparsity, requiring experts to wade through hours of footage to find minutes of relevant activity. Our NNS activity segmentation algorithm solves this problem by identifying periods of NNS with high certainty -- up to 94.0\% average precision and 84.9\% average recall across 30 heterogeneous 60 s clips, drawn from our manually annotated NNS clinical in-crib dataset of 183 hours of overnight baby monitor footage from 19 infants. Our method is based on an underlying NNS action recognition algorithm, which uses spatiotemporal deep learning networks and infant-specific pose estimation, achieving 94.9\% accuracy in binary classification of 960 2.5 s balanced NNS vs. non-NNS clips. Tested on our second, independent, and public NNS in-the-wild dataset, NNS recognition classification reaches 92.3\% accuracy, and NNS segmentation achieves 90.8\% precision and 84.2\% recall.|
